Date of stay: September 2022,50,We enjoyed pur stay at the lantern bar. Julius Tallano who is one of the staff is very accommodating and polite. He even guided us in ordering one the best and unique drinks that i have ever tasted. We will surely recommend lantern bar as a place to visit
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Stunning hotel, backed up by outstanding service. The construction and interior design of the Fullerton Bay make it a unique place to stay. The marina location is as central as it gets and the view across the water to MBS is a great one. We stayed in a third floor corner room, which was high spec and with views of the water on two sides. The rooftop pool is a special area for spending time in central Singapore. The Lantern bar is a great vantage point for evening drinks and watching the light show. The hotel feels more relaxed and less touristy than MBS (which works at MBS, not a slight on that experience- certainly also worth checking out). We stayed with our twenty two month old daughter for two nights. Service was exceptionally good and welcoming, though perhaps the vibe is better suited to families at Shangri-La. Two nights at the end of our trip were memorable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Alvin the butler and Indra on reception were particularly helpful, nothing was too much trouble- very welcome when travelling with a toddler and much appreciated. All their colleagues were also very kind. Perhaps best recommended for couples who want a more chilled, but high-end, boutique experience. Five star review an easy decision."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Had a great time at Lantern! Great ambience! Awesome food! Splendid service from Daniel! Thank you so much for the complimentray birthday cake too! Will definitely revisit! Love the view and the choice of music played!

Date of stay: September 2022,50,I visited here for my bday celebration w my family. It has nice view w great cocktails. Daniel assisted us in professional manner. I definitely will visit again. Highly recommend this place to everyone!
Date of stay: September 2022,50,The Lanter team made us feel like at home. We couldn‚Äôt ask for more they were super attentive to the tiniest detail we couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Julius made sure we weee well taken care of the whole night. We will definitely be back.
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Everything was perfect from my call to book a table and Alan helping with mum‚Äôs bday surprise to JJ, Dinesh and team during the relaxing lunch at La Brasserie. Even the medium Ribeye was so tender and desserts were great! Best ondeh cake I‚Äôve had! Thank you for accommodating my family‚Äôs needs and for the beautiful bday surprise! Just lovely!"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"We came for afternoon tea for birthday celebration. Service was excellent. Lotha who served us was attentive and checked in with us a couple of times. Food was decent, but felt that there were too many sweets with rather repetitive flavour profiles. The ambience and setting was comfortable and relaxing."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"The hotel is beautiful and the room was clean and bright, with an incredible view. But it was the exceptional service provided that made our stay extremely pleasant and comfortable.  Every staff member with whom we came in contact with was polite and professional. However, there are five staff members that were so impressive in their service that we will definitely return to the hotel again.  Every morning, we were greeted so warmly by Ms. Lotha Dimaano at La Brasserie. She was extremely attentive and kind, and always has a smile on her face when speaking to us. She is truly exceptional.  Ms. Connie Leow was very attentive to our dining needs, and never failed to say ‚ÄúEnjoy your meal‚Äù whenever she served us.  Ms. Grace Sng graciously gave us an overview of the different pastries offered at the breakfast buffet, and we enjoyed eating the delicious pastries which we wouldn‚Äôt have tried if not for her.  Your concierges, Mr. Taufik Samadi and Mr. Azlee, are extremely friendly and would always greet us warmly and ask us how our day was. It was truly delightful whenever we see them.  We had a wonderful two week stay, and I have recommended the hotel to all of my colleagues, friends and family. Thank you again for such outstanding service."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Very thankful for the team (Lotha, Karen, Kate, HuiXia, Benson and Anthony) for accommodating our walk in request without any reservations.

Thank you once again!"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Would like to take this opportunity to say special thanks to the Landing Point team, especially Lotha, Karen, Kate, HuiXia. We walked in without any reservations and they still accommodated us with the best service. We had a wonderful time and the food was exquisite and delicious."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"It was a very enjoyable 2-night staycation with absolutely wonderful staff and facilities. Everything was calm and just right for a pandemic rest. The staff especially Lotha, Anna and Kate were so helpful in arranging for meals and helping to sort out last minute changes in our plans.  Gorgeous views in just about every direction from the very well-located hotel. Will definitely be back"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"I visited for a high tea session and it was amazing. Anthony, Xia and Hui helped during the session and made it a wonderful life experience.

Date of stay: August 2022,50,"I got recommended by someone who works in SG. I asked I‚Äôd like to check out a bar with nice view of marina bay sands, Lantern bar is it! People are very nice, warm, and caring. Def nice night view, it would be lovely to come here with your beloved ones. It is not that loud so it is also enjoyable with family."
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"We were served under Anthony and his service was great. Had a birthday cake and he made a complimentary drink for her as well. It was fantastic. Also, we needed to charge our phones cause our portable died and it was tended too. Really a life saver. We also had a complimentary parking since we drove"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"The service rendered by Lotha, Asel and Hui Xia were excellent! Very attentive and accommodating to guests‚Äô needs. They were very welcoming and great at their work as well, explaining the menu to us. Thanks!"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"I had afternoon tea with my family here to celebrate my birthday. The savory dishes were my favorite, especially the duck rillettes and smoked salmon! The variety of teas and coffees we're also very impressive and delicious. Fairus and Lotha were very helpful and accommodating."
Date of stay: August 2022,10,Always used to look forward to and enjoy my stays at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Despite the perfect location for Singapore the Fullerton team are not providing 5 star service. Teamwork looks poor across the various teams be that the kitchen and front office service teams are not working together. Service is slow and disjointed. Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight. After years of being a massive fan of the Fullerton Bay I will not be staying there again and will not be recommending it to friends and family. Simply put the gap between the price you pay and the service you get are too far apart.
Date of stay: August 2022,50,Great service and warm hospitality from Ms Lotha. Thank you Ms Lotha for making the dining experience warm and pleasant to enjoy. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family! The place to go for a chill and relaxing afternoon
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"I had a great afternoon tea experience at The Landing Point at The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore. Special thanks to Karen, Anthony and Lotha for the good service. The Chinese lady who served us coffee was so warm and nice too. Thank you!"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Went to The Landing Point within Fullerton Bay Hotel for the afternoon high tea set. Food and service was excellent, with a great view of Marina bay sands and the waterfront. Special call out to Anthony and Lotha from the service staff, who remembered the little details and even celebrated my friend‚Äôs birthday. Will definitely come back again."
Date of stay: August 2022,20,"Afternoon tea at The Landing Point. What a low quality experience !!! Even without considering the exorbitant cost of the afternoon tea, the experience is not at all nice and quite below expectations. Service was poor. Food nice at appearance but not so interesting at taste. Very disappointing."
Date of stay: September 2021,50,we arrive late in the night and we didn't expect that they still keep the room as we need all the night Manager was very sweet person and had the smart eyes we felt overwhelm with the nice staff then the best thing is the lady in the front they are beauty also
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"We had the vegetarian afternoon tea, and Lotha made the experience extra special with attentive service from start to finish. Grateful to the team too for assigning us a table with a wonderful view of the Marina Bay.  The set is generally good, though there could be more variety to the savoury vegetarian items. Still, kudos for offering allium-free options!"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,I celebrated my 41st Birthday at The Landing Point Fullerton. We had fun in this place and we enjoyed taking pictures too! The staff are accomodating and making sure that we have everything we need! Special thanks to Lotha and Fairus!
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"You should be very proud of your staff who were friendly and very accommodating. Especially big thank you to Indra!!! The room was lovely. We loved the extremely comfortable bed, the atmosphere, the attention to details and the hotel products, snacks and drinks. The restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and the food very good. It was our second stay at your hotel but it wont be the last. We had a wonderful time and felt very comfortable and welcomed at your hotel. Thank you!"
Date of stay: August 2022,50,We had afternoon tea at The Landing Point. It‚Äôs full house but thanks to Lotha she‚Äôs very accommodating and sweet. Love the Sakura and Royal Orchid tea it really compliments the desserts. We had a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands. We will definitely go back.
Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Ambience was gorgeous & the tea spread was absolutely divine! Each item was exquisitely beautiful and delicious. Service was impeccable and we loved the gracious attention of Lotha and Asel. I fedback at end of tea that it was a beautiful birthday celebration and the next thing we knew, they sent a beautiful and complimentary slice of chocolate cake with a candle. So thoughtful! I loved the whole experience and would certainly go again."
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Very home warming fell and great services from the staff. Went for the hi tea, they change a new menu display the best menu and matching with a great choice of tea or coffee. The service by the team is great and always timely and patience. Great introduction and recommends of the hitea item and what drinks is matching ."
Date of stay: July 2022,50,Visited The Landing Point with a friend on 26 Jul 2022. Lotha & Karen were very helpful and attentive. Food was yummy as well! Definitely will return again. Thanks for the excellent service and food! :)
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"This property, its staff, service, rooms and facilities are all top notch. The rooms are spacious and luxurious with large bathrooms that include tubs and showers. The bed is ultra luxe and comfortable. Rooms even have a private balcony.  The breakfast buffet in the morning and the hot entrees are amazing. Service in the breakfast restaurant is also amazing - JJ deserves extra kudos!!  The gym and pool area are on the rooftop and very clean, modern and well maintained. Lobby bar is a great feature for meetings and casual dining.  I simply loved my entire stay!!"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"This hotel is now my new go to hotel when in Singapore. Worth every $$$. Check-in process was smooth and staff were friendly and approachable. Room was amazing and had a great view, was unexpectedly large and had everything we wanted. Location was perfect and it was only a short walk to most places we wanted to visit. Breakfast was perfect and meals were freshly made if required. Again - all staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for them. Room was comfortable, bathroom was huge and absolutely no problems at all with our stay. Will definitely be staying again"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"This is our favorite hotel in Singapore. We go often and we have had a chance to try several of the top hotels. This is by far the best one. The location is slightly off so you always need a car. But if you are staying here, you probably have a car waiting for you anyway. We love the rooms and the rooftop pool. The food at the cafe for breakfast is delicious too. We highly recommend Fullerton Bay and please do not confuse it with Fullerton Hotel, which is the post office hotel. Fullerton Bay is much nicer."
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Experienced the newly launched ‚ÄúExpressions Afternoon Tea‚Äù today. Distinctive new menu of pastries and savoury items. Facing Marina Bay, we had an enjoyable afternoon as we while the time away with the good food and drinks. Recommended."
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"We stay four nights It,s a beautiful place The ubication is the best and I recommended the room with bay views You can see Marina bay and at night is espectacular The breakfast has big quality The staff are also very kind and efficient and they help you about the city etc Perhaps the cleaning service are not so good The wifi is good The rooms are big with a very good toilet I think it is a very good option for stay in Singapore"
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"This hotel was by far the best part of our week long trip to Singapore. It is a great location within walking distance to lots of restaurants and with a great view of the harbor. The roof top infinity pool is terrific and we appreciated the unlimited Spring water. The breakfast was amazing- it was made to order with great choices of delicious western and Asian food. Our deluxe room was very comfortable. The complimentary tour of the historic sister property the Fullerton- which was originally a post office- was very interesting for the architecture as well as the history. However, the best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We were especially grateful that the hotel arranged for someone to come to our room to perform the Covid tests that were required until recently to return to to the US. It eliminated all the hassle of a stressful situation. We‚Äôve stayed in top properties all over the world and have found that the hotels in Asia are the best but this was the best of the best."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The Fullerton Bay Hotel occupies the premium position on Marina Bay. We had a room with point-blank views of the iconic buildings on the waterfront. The room, as all the rooms, are large and clean; and the hotel staff, whether front-of-room, cleaning and dining are all friendly, efficient and professional. The only thing I can think to improve it, is to add USB connections for charging."
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Good service and friendly staff who are very attentive, good room view and very clean, good environment for a nice relaxing holiday and very conducive to do work, good location as it is very near a lot of food places and iconic sights"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,Stayed at the beautiful Robinson Suite. The views were fantastic. Olivia Hee is a great Butler and went out of her way to make us have a wonderful stay. She definitely elevated our experience at the Fullerton Bay.
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Of the several excellent hotels in the Marina Bay area, this is the only one that is literally on the waterfront (and also low-rise), so that you really have the feel of being on the bay. We had a theme suite on the top (6th) floor, which was a very spacious and well-appointed room, but (because it was a big corner room) also had a 270-degree view of the whole of the Bay, some of the financial district buildings, etc. Service was good and responsive."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,First class modern hotel with sweeping views of the bay. Great service. Rooms serviced several times a day. Great rooftop pool and bar. Breakfast ok but not as good as the rest of the hotel. Get an exclusive of breakfast rate if you can. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Just Book it and walk in the door and you will understand why!!! Cant fault this place, the staff, the location, the cleanliness. The room sizes are very spacious with everything you can ask for. The pool is magnificent and has a great view."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,Excellent hotel with fantastic views and facilities. Staff were pleasant and helpful - they went out of the way to help us with every request. This was the best staycation we ever had. Amazing experience!
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"5 stars all over, location, service, food and accommodations. Unforgettable family trip. Although flights were long and luggage missed the connecting flight and arrived 2 days later, it was worth it. Enjoyed some Michelin star restaurants plus the nightly light shows at the Marina. Changi airport is very clean and efficient. VAT refunds were efficient. There are no priority ques for business class travelers but there was no need. The facial recognition check in was very fast. Security check is prior to boarding the flight so one must allow sufficient time to board. Singapore should be on everyone's bucket list or must visit list. Caters to all ages and tastes."
Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Beautiful comfy room bay view. Thanks to ndp rehearsal, we witness aircraft rehearsal outside our balcony, and thanks to i-light event, beautiful night lights all over mbs. Beautiful night view‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"It's a good hotel, the staff friendly, the food was good, room so clean, they give a new toiletries everyday, the rooftop and the pool so beautiful. maybe you can provide more variety of breakfast in the future"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"I reserved the hotel for a business trip as it was recommended from my colleagues. Clean and modern hotel, with good view of the Marina Bay Sands. Also walking distance (when cool) to the Marina Bay Sands shopping center and very close to Lau Pa Sat, where you can casually join local food. Would recommend for anyone wishing to enjoy some time aside from business in the financial district across."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Wonderful experience, we got hitched at the Fullerton pods then stayed overnight at the corner room. Beautiful top to bottom with an extremely helpful staff there every step of the way, for our special day."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The point of difference with this hotel for me was the level of effort the staff go to for their guests when required. We had some bad luck on arrival, after which the staff and management made sure the rest of our stay went swimmingly. The rooms are good, service excellent, and food tasty. Thank you!"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,Check in was a breeze and we were greeted to a beautiful room with unobstructed views of Marina Bay. It was a sight to behold. Really enjoyed sipping tea by the balcony and admiring the city both in the day and night. The service at the hotel was also fantastic with great attention to detail. The room was luxurious and I would definitely return again in future. Special thanks to the team at Fullerton Bay Hotel for making the stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one!
Date of stay: June 2022,30,"Came here for a family staycation. Service was good, as expected from a 5 star hotel. They had good kids amenities for children below 7.  However, the room is quite underwhelming considering the price paid. Bathtub drainage was spoiled which was a huge bummer for us."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore. The hotel is located in a beautiful location overlooking Singapore Harbour - would definately recommend spending the extra for the Bay View Rooms. This really is a 5 star resort. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and a special mention to Oliver from Room Service who seemed to always be there for us, he was extremely attentive and pleasant and made our trip very special. Would highly recommend this hotel either for a short or long stay. Also, the pool area I think is better than the pool at Marina Bay Sands resort, it is private and intimate and the pool service is exceptional."
Date of stay: June 2022,20,"This is an amazing hotel and l have loved it from previous stays however it‚Äôs pretty clear FBH does not have the staff it needs to service it‚Äôs guests.  I stayed to enjoy the pool for my last day of a trip and there were literally zero staff around. Guests towels, cups, rubbish was not cleaned all day and just sat there. Birds had the opportunity to enjoy the left overs.  Also no one to greet you when you arrive or assist with luggage etc. I had come from mandarin oriental which didn‚Äôt appear to suffer the same staff shortages.  The hotel is still beautiful and has lovely facilities I just hope they sort out the staffing issues soon."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"The Fullerton Bay is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at ever. The quality overall is fantastic, the location is great and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I will be coming back and staying here every time I‚Äôm in Singapore"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Vanessa at the front desk deserved many thumbs up. From the time of check-in, we were impressed with her service. When asked for the view from our premier room, she was able to advise us that there was a higher category of room available, at a good price upgrade. We immediately grabbed the offer. No regrets! She also gave us a complimentary late checkout. Everyone must really try the bayview room, the full view of mbs when you wake up is really gorgeous. We were thankful for the stay as we enjoyed ourselves throughout the stay. Special thanks to Alvin the head butler for extending the free ice cream for my child but we didn't manage to go back the next day to redeem.  2 years ago and 2 years from now, the room condition still looks really good though the bathtub knobs for the hot water portion can be improved(a bit too tight). Food wise, I think the food tasted better two years ago (not sure why, the beef burger tasted quite normal and the club sandwich was kinda dry) but staff service from the food establishments was pretty good. Would go back again. Consider to give a good offer for returning guests. :) thank you FBH for this wonderful staycaytion."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"One of my favourite hotels in the city. High standards and extremely well located. Helpful and professional staff. Impeccable rooms. Great facilities, including several restaurants where I can have business guests."
Date of stay: March 2022,50,"The Fullerton Bay Hotel is an absolutely lovely property and doesn't hold its #1 position on TripAdvisor by luck. A very warm welcome when we first arrived and continual touches of brilliance throughout or 6 night stay. If you are reading this review then be confident that as per all of the other great reviews, this is an extremely nice place to stay.  We were hugely impressed by the Concierge and especially Andrew Yip who was a constant source of information, assistance and recommendations. Andrew's guidance for our first ever visit to Singapore was invaluable and we can't thank him enough. He must have been glad to see the back of me after the amount of things I asked him, but everything was dealt with quickly, efficiently and with a smile. He also seems to work 24/7 as whatever time of day or night I came back to the hotel Andrew seemed to there to great us! Brilliant Service - Thank you Andrew.  We look forward to coming back to Singapore and already know where we will be staying!"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"We stayed here between May 29 and June 10. Had a great experience with very caring and responsive staff. Would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others. Fantastic location from our perspective. Some issues with access to Concierge but when we finally connected, all was fine!"
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"hello, I will tell you about my experience, the hotel has many amenities such as the possibility of breakfast, lunch and dinner, without a little expensive but it is delicious, eating at the hotel makes the experience much easier, I loved its positioning, since it is central, the workers are very friendly and you can go out to see new places since they are close to the hotel, if you go and need internet, the hotel has Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, its rooms are super large, comfortable and very clean, without thinking it is a wonderful place and highly recommended..."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,"A beautiful hotel in a great location by the lake with a great view of Marina Sand Hotel and with a wonderful rooftop bar, The Latern. The Fuller Bay Hotel is a great high quality hotel and rooms and a wonderful and serviceminded staff . Just a great week in Singapore at Fullerton Bay Hotel."
Date of stay: June 2022,40,"Great location Recommend to stay in the bay view room to see the symbol of Singapore. But I want to improve a lot of things like TV remote, old dvd player and need to clean the bathroom more. I found a lot of mold in the shower area. And the swimming pool in the hotel is old and inefficient. Other than that, I also encountered a problem with the key card. I can't enter my room. The hotel has too few staff."
Date of stay: June 2022,50,Decided to book a trip for my family and it was so pleasant that we are missing it now.  The staff are friendly and the food is so nice.  Facilities are new and overall it is a good place for family and friends
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Conveniently located allowing walk by foot to the Marina Bay area as well as to the Raffles Place area which means you can shop, dine and also do your business meetings if those happen in the Raffles business district. Also great running course towards the back of MBS where there is a park with paved roads. In terms of the hotel, you will get great service, good food, a decent gym and a great outdoor pool on the rooftop where you can do laps."
Date of stay: May 2022,40,Very comfortable hotel. In addition the location of the hotel is very well. I recommend this hotel for a stay in Singapore whatever the reason of this stay. In addition the staff is very professional.

Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Dear Fullerton Bay,  We would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care we received at your hotel from 24th May to 26th May 2022.  I was there for 2 nights with my wife and for all these days we were attended with utmost warmth. We were impressed to see the prompt room service despite the peak season.  To front desk manager Indra, who has been nothing short of phenomenal. He is warm, friendly & professional. The genuine smile on his face when we received the two couple bears revealed his true interest in wanting us to be happy!  We would like to express our most sincere thanks once again to Indra for making our wedding anniversary such a memorable one.  Indra, continue to shine and to be Fullerton Bay‚Äôs walking ambassador.

Date of stay: May 2022,40,Wonderful Hotel in a perfect spot. The price / performance ration was not fully appropriate. The rooms and the maid service were perfect. The Rooftop view with the pool are awesome. The breakfast could have more selection.
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Me and my fiance were there for one night but we enjoyed our stay here; the front desk staff were helpful with my enquiries, the room was clean and immaculate on arrival and the breakfast was fantastic with the a la carte and buffet options. Next time I return to Singapore, we will stay here longer!"
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"The Anderson suite was fantastic. From the cleanliness and serviceability of the room to the panoramic view.  The jacuzzi room was beyond imagination. Once in a lifetime experience. Though we felt that the toilet was a downgrade from the suite. Automatic toilet bowls, bidet, dual sinks could be added.  All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would definitely be back!"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Back again at this fantastic hotel. We were able to check in fairly early which was appreciated, beautiful rooms and bathrooms and a nice balcony to enjoy. The beds are comfortable with nice bedding. The service is mostly very good, but during breakfast it was at times not so good, things were forgotten, wrong meals delivered and having to wait for a long time to be served. What really disappointed us was that there was no restaurant service by the pool, The Lantern did not open until 5 PM, this was not OK, meaning no drinks or food beeing served until late afternoon. Hope the opening hours will change eventually. At night a great place to be serving drinks with a smile Had a nice afternoon tea our last day. Will absolutely be back"
Date of stay: April 2022,40,"The experience overall was very good. The location is pretty much perfect, also the service in general is excellent, so is the wow effect when you arrive. So why not a five then? First, having stayed in manny similar hotels elsewhere in Asia, I was surprised by the narrow options for breakfast (which is usually one key feature of many high end hotels in the region), maybe it is was due to Covid restrictions, but I was quite surprised to see that there were only a few a la carte options, rather than the usual massive spread of different buffet and a la carte alternatives. My second negative comment is regarding the fitness facilities. The gym is basically two treadmills and a few weights cramped on a 30m2 space‚Ä¶if there more than two people at the same time you are bumping into each other, which is the opposite you want on any gym, let alone in a place like this. In a hotel of the characteristics of this one, an average guest would expect something substantially better. Overall it was a great experience, and probably the two comments I made should be easy to fix."
Date of stay: May 2022,20,"On my first visit to Singapore in 3 years, I was extremely disappointed in the Fullerton Bay. On Arrival my wife was shown to our room...to discover another guest had already been checked into it. Not an issue, mistakes happen, until the front desk clerk tried to insist she take the room once luggage had been removed.."" The room was cleaned, it is fine"" ...as in cleaned before someone else put their luggage in it and had access. Other than that, the hotel was not really fully open. The rooftop restaurant was closed until 5 pm, and other outlets were usually full, or in the case of The Brasserie, horrible. Again, staff was overall unhelpful and aloof."
Date of stay: May 2022,50,"Celebrated mother's day here! Not too crowded which was good. Food and drinks were good! If you want a quiet night in, this is the place! Loges was also very attentive and helpful. Cheers mate and thank you for the flower for my mum!"

Good night view from Lantern at the rooftop bar and restaurant.  Rated 4 of 5, leaving space for self improvement."
Date of stay: January 2022,50,Stayed here for New Year's Eve and the 3 following days. The hotel is just stunning! the palatial dining area for the special New Year's Eve dinner was amazing. the hotel has restored some of the old dockside buildings and connected them up with ultra modern building. The room was beautifully laid out as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The pool was quite stunning too! Staff were very hospitable and welcoming.
Date of stay: April 2022,40,"Good location. Nice hotel. If there could be more variety of food, it would be ideal (consider to include Japanese food?) Overall, it is a nice hotel with good bay view. A relaxed fantastic stay. I would recommend this hotel."
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"We hosted our wedding at The Clifford Pier and everything was amazing.

Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Good covid precautions. Excellent concierge desk including Amsyar and Muhammad. Excellent front desk and manager Andrew.

Date of stay: March 2022,50,"I love everything about this hotel. The airport transport arrangement, the room, the food, the staff, and did I mention the location. My room overlooked Marina Bay, and it was a marvelous sight to see at night, as the Sands lit up the bay. The staff was attentive to my every whim and need. The food was outstanding. Can't be beat. Perhaps my favorite hotel in Singapore. You won't be disappointed."
Date of stay: April 2022,30,"overall it was not so bad, but I feel my package price was bit over price and not all contents for kid was available during my stay. But, if you really go, please check with Farm tour to find Joe who was excellent guide for my family!"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"From my experience the best hotel in Singapore!! Great service from the concierge, especially Syahir in the concierge and Andrew in reception -5 starts to them! They really gave the little extra! However all staff were very helpful and nice. Breakfast was gorgeous, good variety to choose from, great staff (again!) gorgeous atmosphere (the whole hotel), very clean and spotless! Spacious rooms with great layout. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar with great view of the city and marina bay sands. We enjoyed every part of it! We are very picky travellers but Fullerton Bay hit all the boxes and will be our choice again when we are back in Singapore! Thank you for making our trip so great!"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Had a one night staycation over the Easter weekend with a couple of friends in a bay view room. We would like to thank Kelly, Andrew, Alvin for their warm hospitality and various prompt follow ups whenever we had any requests. Oliver also also offered to help us store our drinks in the hotel fridge when we mentioned the in room fridge was not cold.  We had a good time and experience at the pool as well as Lantern bar for drinks in the evening. We were well served by Zool, Loges and Daniel who ensured our birthday celebration was tip top. They consistently checked in on us to ensure we have everything we need despite our table being located in the far corner of the bar.  Breakfast in the morning was also a very grand affair. We were well taken care of by the team at La Brasserie including Mono, Lotha, Emma and Dolly who ensured the experience was flawless and smooth. The food served were also delicious and of superior quality. The seafood congee was extremely well seasoned, while waffles and pancakes were served fluffy and not overdone.  In essence, the staff really puts in effort to remember our preferences, they are also extremely knowledgeable and consistently go above and beyond to make our stay a better one.  I highly recommend this hotel!"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,This hotel is 6 star in my opinion & has a fabulous view of Marina Bay Sands which in my opinion is much better than staying there! The staff here like Kelly Yugen and Amsyar made it an incredible stay. I will be back!
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Excellent location, service, facilities and the view is breathtaking. A lot of things to do and see near the hotel. All walking distance, and for all ages. Will be definitely coming back. Totally recommended."
Date of stay: April 2022,50,My wife and I came here to spend our honeymoon after waiting a long time to be finally able to travel again and the experience was outstanding. The building is beautiful and the meals were fantastic. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Service is really good, and they made us feel very comfortable. the food is good at well, loved the oysters. Ingredients are really fresh. The ambience is cosy and comfortable. Enjoyed our celebrations a lot :)"
Date of stay: April 2022,50,It‚Äôs definitely one of the best and most memorable stay in Singapore. The view from Bay View Room was fantastic - bathtub cannot be better designed this way as the whole Marina Bay seems so peaceful. The little balcony also made a difference as many other hotels of the area doesn‚Äôt have this part. I actually feel like I‚Äôm on a luxury cruise!
Date of stay: April 2022,50,"Great service, perfect rooms and the people working at the hotel are very professional, kind and service minded (special thanks to Kelly)). Fullerton and Singapore is the perfect combination, hope to come back soon."
Date of stay: April 2022,10,"What a beautiful hotel but when I checked in, the front desk was rude and inattentive. She truly ruined the experience. I tried to be polite but I guess she had a bad day and took it out on the client. I believe that customer experience is very vital to all guests. It was truly a disappointment considering I was so excited to stay there . It was my very first time"
